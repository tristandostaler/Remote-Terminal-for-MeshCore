    A login that draws no reply at all may mean the stored direct route has gone
    stale, so it escalates to one flood retry — mirroring the DM send path, which
    already resets the path before its final attempt. This is deliberately more
    than the reference clients do: firmware ``sendLogin`` and ``send_login_sync``
    are both single-shot, and firmware only clears a stale path when the *host*
    asks it to (``CMD_RESET_PATH``). Escalating is still the right call because
    the server side treats an inbound flood as its cue to relearn the return path
    (``simple_repeater``/``simple_room_server``: ``if (is_flood)
    client->out_path_len = OUT_PATH_UNKNOWN``), so a flood login is exactly what
    repairs a broken route in both directions.

    Escalation is bounded to a single extra attempt and only fires when:
      - the first attempt timed out. An explicit ``LOGIN_FAILED`` means the
        server heard us and refused, so the route is fine and retrying would
        just hammer it with bad credentials. A send error is a local radio
        problem that a different route will not fix.
      - the first attempt actually used a route. If the contact was already on
        flood, the retry would be byte-identical for no gain.

    ``reset_path`` clears the route on the radio only; the stored contact route
    is left alone, so the next ``add_contact`` re-stages it. That matches the DM
    retry and keeps a single bad login from discarding a route that may be fine.
