# Backend AGENTS.md

This document is the backend working guide for agents and developers.
Keep it aligned with `app/` source files and router behavior.

## Stack

- FastAPI
- aiosqlite
- Pydantic
- MeshCore Python library (`meshcore` from PyPI)
- PyCryptodome

## Code Ethos

- Prefer strong domain modules over layers of pass-through helpers.
- Split code when the new module owns real policy, not just a nicer name.
- Avoid wrapper services around globals unless they materially improve testability or reduce coupling.
- Keep workflows locally understandable; do not scatter one reasoning unit across several files without a clear contract.
- Typed write/read contracts are preferred over loose dict-shaped repository inputs.

## Core Runtime Flows

### Incoming data

1. Radio emits events.
2. `on_rx_log_data` stores raw packet and tries decrypt/pipeline handling.
3. Shared message-domain services create/update `messages` and shape WS payloads.
4. Direct-message storage is centralized in `services/dm_ingest.py`; packet-processor DMs and `CONTACT_MSG_RECV` fallback events both route through that seam.

### Outgoing messages

1. Send endpoints in `routers/messages.py` validate requests and delegate to `services/message_send.py`.
2. Service-layer send workflows call MeshCore commands, persist outgoing messages, and wire ACK tracking.
3. Endpoint broadcasts WS `message` event so all live clients update.
4. ACK/repeat updates arrive later as `message_acked` events.
5. Channel resend (`POST /messages/channel/{id}/resend`) strips the sender name prefix by exact match against the current radio name. This assumes the radio name hasn't changed between the original send and the resend. Name changes require an explicit radio config update and are rare, but the `new_timestamp=true` resend path has no time window, so a mismatch is possible if the name was changed between the original send and a later resend.

### Connection lifecycle

- `RadioManager.start_connection_monitor()` checks health every 5s.
- `RadioManager.post_connect_setup()` delegates to `services/radio_lifecycle.py`.
- Routers, startup/lifespan code, fanout helpers, and `radio_sync.py` should reach radio state through `services/radio_runtime.py`, not by importing `app.radio.radio_manager` directly.
- Shared reconnect/setup helpers in `services/radio_lifecycle.py` are used by startup, the monitor, and manual reconnect/reboot flows before broadcasting healthy state.
- Setup still includes handler registration, key export, time sync, contact/channel sync, and advertisement tasks. The message-poll task always starts: by default it runs as a low-frequency hourly audit, and `MESHCORE_ENABLE_MESSAGE_POLL_FALLBACK=true` switches it to aggressive 10-second polling. That audit checks both missed-radio-message drift and channel-slot cache drift; cache mismatches are logged, toasted, and the send-slot cache is reset.
- Post-connect setup is timeout-bounded. If initial radio offload/setup hangs too long, the backend logs the failure and broadcasts an `error` toast telling the operator to reboot the radio and restart the server.

## Important Behaviors

### Companion repeat mode

- Companion firmware (protocol version 9+) can relay mesh packets for other nodes. The flag is reported in the `DEVICE_INFO` frame (byte 80, parsed as `repeat`) and written through the `SET_RADIO_PARAMS` command's trailing repeat byte, so toggling it always re-sends the full radio parameter set (`app/services/repeat_mode.py`).
- Every `set_radio(...)` call carries the current repeat flag when firmware supports it, so a plain frequency change never clears repeat by omission.
- Firmware only relays on the shared off-grid frequencies. Devices that implement `GET_ALLOWED_REPEAT_FREQ` report the permitted ranges (units vary between Hz/kHz/MHz across builds and are normalized by magnitude); older ones fall back to 433/869/918 MHz, matching the official apps.
- `app/services/device_query.py` is the shared device-query seam: it returns the parsed payload *and* the raw frame, because stale `.pyc` copies of the meshcore reader silently drop the newest fields (`repeat`, `path_hash_mode`) from an otherwise healthy response.

### Multibyte routing

- Packet `path_len` values are hop counts, not byte counts.
- Hop width comes from the packet or radio `path_hash_mode`: `0` = 1-byte, `1` = 2-byte, `2` = 3-byte.
- Channel slot count comes from firmware-reported `DEVICE_INFO.max_channels`; do not hardcode `40` when scanning/offloading channel slots.
- Channel sends use a session-local LRU slot cache after startup channel offload clears the radio. Repeated sends to the same channel reuse the loaded slot; new channels fill free slots up to the discovered channel capacity, then evict the least recently used cached channel.
- TCP radios do not reuse cached slot contents. For TCP, channel sends still force `set_channel(...)` before every send because this backend does not have exclusive device access.
- `MESHCORE_FORCE_CHANNEL_SLOT_RECONFIGURE=true` disables slot reuse on all transports and forces the old always-`set_channel(...)` behavior before every channel send.
- Contacts persist canonical direct-route fields (`direct_path`, `direct_path_len`, `direct_path_hash_mode`) so contact sync and outbound DM routing reuse the exact stored hop width instead of inferring from path bytes.
- Direct-route sources are limited to radio contact sync (`out_path`) and PATH/path-discovery updates. This mirrors firmware `onContactPathRecv(...)`, which replaces `ContactInfo.out_path` when a new returned path is heard.
- `route_override_path`, `route_override_len`, and `route_override_hash_mode` take precedence over the learned direct route for radio-bound sends.
- Advertisement paths are stored only in `contact_advert_paths` for analytics/visualization. They are not part of `Contact.to_radio_dict()` or DM route selection.
- `contact_advert_paths` identity is `(public_key, path_hex, path_len)` because the same hex bytes can represent different routes at different hop widths.

### Read/unread state

- Server is source of truth (`contacts.last_read_at`, `channels.last_read_at`).
- `GET /api/read-state/unreads` returns counts, mention flags, `last_message_times`, `last_read_ats`, and `first_unread_ids`.
- `first_unread_ids` maps stateKey -> id of the oldest unread message, so the client can anchor the unread divider (and jump to it) without paging back through history. It is computed with `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY type, conversation_key ORDER BY received_at, id)` — deliberately not `MIN(received_at)` with a bare id, because sender timestamps are whole seconds and same-second ties are routine, and not `MIN(id)`, because historical decryption inserts old messages with new ids.

### DM ingest + ACKs

- `services/dm_ingest.py` is the one place that should decide fallback-context resolution, DM dedup/reconciliation, and packet-linked vs. content-based storage behavior.
- `CONTACT_MSG_RECV` is a fallback path, not a parallel source of truth. If you change DM storage behavior, trace both `event_handlers.py` and `packet_processor.py`.
- DM ACK tracking is an in-memory pending/buffered map in `services/dm_ack_tracker.py`, with periodic expiry from `radio_sync.py`.
- Outgoing DMs send once inline, store/broadcast immediately after the first successful `MSG_SENT`, then may retry up to 2 more times in the background only when the initial `MSG_SENT` result includes an expected ACK code and the message remains unacked.
- DM retry timing follows the firmware-provided `suggested_timeout` from `PACKET_MSG_SENT`; do not replace it with a fixed app timeout unless you intentionally want more aggressive duplicate-prone retries.
- Direct-message send behavior is intended to emulate `meshcore_py.commands.send_msg_with_retry(...)` when the radio provides an expected ACK code: stage the effective contact route on the radio, send, wait for ACK, and on the final retry force flood via `reset_path(...)`.
- Non-final DM attempts use the contact's effective route (`override > direct > flood`). The final retry is intentionally sent as flood even when a routing override exists.
- DM ACK state is terminal on first ACK. Retry attempts may register multiple expected ACK codes for the same message, but sibling pending codes are cleared once one ACK wins so a DM should not accrue multiple delivery confirmations from retries.
- ACKs are delivery state, not routing state. Bundled ACKs inside PATH packets still satisfy pending DM sends, but ACK history does not feed contact route learning.
- DM ACKs are matched from two independent radio emissions, so confirmation does not depend on the radio surfacing a host control frame: (1) the `EventType.ACK`/`SEND_CONFIRMED` host frame via `event_handlers.on_ack`, and (2) the raw RF packet itself via `packet_processor.process_raw_packet`. The packet processor extracts ACK codes both from PATH-return packets (flood replies, ACK embedded in `extra`) and from standalone `PayloadType.ACK` packets (direct replies, 4-byte cleartext payload), feeding both into `apply_dm_ack_code`. This matters for companion firmwares (e.g. pyMC over TCP) that do not reliably emit a separate host ACK frame for direct-routed replies.

### Server login route escalation

`prepare_authenticated_contact_connection` (`routers/server_control.py`, shared by repeater and room login) sends one login over the contact's effective route. If that draws **no reply at all**, it calls `reset_path(...)` and retries exactly once as flood.

This is intentionally *more* than the reference implementations do — do not "correct" it back to single-shot:
- Firmware `BaseChatMesh::sendLogin` picks flood only when `out_path_len == OUT_PATH_UNKNOWN` and never retries; `CMD_SEND_LOGIN` calls it once.
- `meshcore_py` has `send_msg_with_retry` (with `flood_after` + `reset_path`) but no login equivalent — `send_login`/`send_login_sync` are single-shot.
- Firmware only clears a stale path when the *host* asks (`CMD_RESET_PATH`); client-side path learning is otherwise passive via `onContactPathRecv`.

Escalating is still correct because the **server** side treats an inbound flood as its cue to relearn the return path (`simple_repeater`/`simple_room_server`: `if (is_flood) client->out_path_len = OUT_PATH_UNKNOWN`). A flood login is therefore what repairs a broken route in both directions, and login gates the whole repeater dashboard.

Escalation is bounded to one extra attempt and only fires when:
- the first attempt **timed out**. `LOGIN_FAILED` means the server heard us and refused, so the route is fine and retrying only hammers it with bad credentials; a send error is a local radio problem a different route will not fix.
- the contact was **not already on flood** (`effective_route_source != "flood"`), since the retry would otherwise be byte-identical.

The retry deliberately does not re-run `_ensure_on_radio` — re-adding the contact would restore the route just cleared. `reset_path` clears the route on the radio only; the stored contact route is untouched, so the next `add_contact` re-stages it. That mirrors the DM retry and keeps one bad login from discarding a route that may be fine.

### Echo/repeat dedup

- Channel message uniqueness (`idx_messages_dedup_null_safe`): `(type, conversation_key, text, COALESCE(sender_timestamp, 0))` where `type = 'CHAN'`.
- Incoming PRIV message uniqueness (`idx_messages_incoming_priv_dedup`): `(type, conversation_key, text, COALESCE(sender_timestamp, 0), COALESCE(sender_key, ''))` where `type = 'PRIV' AND outgoing = 0` — `sender_key` was added in migration 056 to distinguish room-server posts from different senders in the same second.
- Duplicate insert is treated as an echo/repeat: the new path (if any) is appended, and the ACK count is incremented only for outgoing channel messages. Incoming direct messages with the same dedup identity also collapse onto one stored row, with later observations merging path data instead of creating a second DM.

### MCMP text compression

- MCMP (`app/compression/`) is a Python port of meshcore-open's arithmetic text compressor (n-gram model in `models/model-en-ru.json`), wire-compatible with it and dimapanov/mesh-compressor. Compressed bodies ride as ordinary message text behind an `mcmp2:` (v2) or `mcmp3:` (v3 metadata container) prefix.
- **Decode on ingest:** `decode_incoming_body()` is called at every message ingest route — `create_message_from_decrypted` and `create_fallback_channel_message` (channels, raw-RF + get_msg) and `_store_direct_message` (DMs) — so the DB/search/bots see plaintext and content dedup stays consistent across routes. It never raises; a non-MCMP or malformed body is stored unchanged.
- **Encode on send:** opt-in per conversation via `contacts.mcmp_enabled` / `channels.mcmp_enabled` (migration 066); the transport is selectable via `mcmp_version` (2 or 3; migration 067, default 2). `message_send.py` compresses only the transmitted body — v2 uses "only if smaller", v3 always wraps its container (carrying the message timestamp). The stored/broadcast text stays plaintext. `encode_outbound(text, version=, timestamp=)` is deterministic (v3 uses the sender timestamp) so DM retries and channel resends send identical bytes.
- **Bots:** MCMP is transparent to bots. Incoming handlers see decoded plaintext (decode runs at ingest, before the broadcast the bot engine consumes), and `ctx.reply`/`send`/`send_dm` go through the same send path, so bot replies compress per the target conversation's `mcmp_enabled`/`mcmp_version`. `ctx.reply_split` sizes parts by their *compressed* wire length when the conversation has MCMP enabled (`split_text_compressed`), so it packs more text per message. Its budget comes from `resolve_message_budget` (156 bytes for a DM, 156 minus the radio's `"<name>: "` framing for a channel) -- the same number the image transport and the compose counter use; a flat budget let channel parts overrun the frame, and a truncated MCMP part just decodes short with no error.
- **Not implemented:** v3 Ed25519 signing (needs firmware) — v3 is sent unsigned and signed v3 from peers is decoded with the signature skipped, never verified. Decode is lenient (no re-encode verify) to tolerate cross-libm float drift.
- **Per-message facts:** `app/compression/metadata.py` turns a (plaintext, wire payload) pair into the codec + byte counts the chat meta line renders. One symmetric entry point serves both directions — `describe_compression()` on send, `decode_and_describe()` on ingest — so a sent and a received copy of the same message report identical numbers. Persisted on the row (see below), never recomputed at render time.
  - The **ratio** is measured over `payload_bytes`, the compressed-text segment, which for v3 *excludes* the container header. That matches meshcore-open (`lib/models/message_compression.dart`) so both clients quote the same percentage for one message. `wire_bytes` separately records what actually went on air, because a v3 container can be *larger* on air than v2 for the same text — quoting only the ratio would misrepresent the airtime, so the UI puts `wire_bytes` in the tooltip.
  - The ratio is measured against the message **body**, not the stored text: the firmware prepends `"<name>: "` to channel messages outside the compressed payload, so counting the prefix would understate the saving.

### Message send progress

- `messages` carries `send_attempts` / `send_max_attempts` / `send_state` (migration 074) so the chat can show "attempt 2 of 3" and distinguish a send still being retried from one that gave up or was cancelled. **Delivery is not a state** — it stays derived from `acked > 0`, so a late ACK on a `failed` message still displays as delivered, and there is one source of truth for delivery.
- `send_max_attempts` is written per message from the cap in force at send time (`resolve_max_send_attempts`), not read from settings at render time, so the displayed "N of M" stays truthful after the user moves the dial. A manual retry starts a **fresh run** (attempts reset to 1 under the current cap) rather than accumulating, which would eventually display "attempt 7 of 3".
- The cap is `app_settings.max_message_retries`, bounded 1–10 by `app/send_attempts.py` and clamped on both read and write. It applies to **direct messages only** — channel messages have no ACK to wait for and keep their one-shot echo watchdog (`auto_resend_channel`). Every transmission counts, including that watchdog resend and a byte-perfect channel resend, or the meta line would claim one send for a message that went out twice.
- `app/services/send_tracker.py` maps message id → the background task still working on it, which is what makes cancelling possible. Cancelling is best-effort by nature: only attempts *not yet made* can be stopped. The **canceller** records and broadcasts the `canceled` state, not the unwinding task — an `await` inside a `CancelledError` handler can be interrupted again before it completes.
- Progress is broadcast as `message_status` (separate from `message_acked`: progress and delivery are different facts). Deleting broadcasts `message_deleted`; it cancels first, since "delete" has to mean we stop transmitting it. Delete is local only — the mesh has no unsend.

### Raw media transport (shared by images and voice)

- `app/services/raw_media.py` owns the `CMD_SEND_RAW_DATA` send that both the `IE4:` image and `VE3:` voice formats use to move fragments. It used to live in `app/services/voice.py` because voice landed first, which meant image fixes appeared as changes to the voice module and a failure while opening a picture reported itself as `raw voice send failed`. **Nothing in that module may say "voice" or "image"** — its errors surface verbatim in the UI, so shared wording is "raw media".
- Route bounds come from the packet header and nothing tighter: the 6-bit path-length field (63) and `MAX_PATH_SIZE` (64 bytes), whichever binds first at the route's path hash width — 63 hops for 1-byte hashes, 32 for 2-byte, 21 for 3-byte, matching the reference client's `_isPathLenValidForMode`. An earlier hardcoded 3-hop cap was not a protocol limit and made media unfetchable from anything further away. Path hash mode 3 stays refused, consistent with `app/path_utils.py`, which documents it as reserved.
- Firmware without `CMD_SEND_RAW_DATA` raises `RawDataUnsupportedError` (→ HTTP 501), not a bare `RuntimeError` (→ 502), because retrying cannot help: without that command neither format moves a fragment in either direction. **MCO Advanced never sends raw data at all**, so this transport has no reference implementation to interoperate with.

### Media session retention (images, voice)

- `image_sessions` and `voice_sessions` hold the fragments behind an `IE4:`/`VE3:` envelope. A session is kept for as long as **any** message still references it (migration 075, `media_session_messages`); only sessions nothing references fall back to the old 24 h TTL plus newest-N sweep. Before that, media older than the TTL vanished while its message stayed in the conversation — a 404 on `/content` for your own messages, and a fetch request silently ignored for everyone else's.
- References live in their own table because the relationship is genuinely many-to-one: re-sending or pasting an envelope, and sending media to yourself, all produce several messages for one session. The single `message_id` on the session row cannot express that, so pinning on it would drop media the moment its *first* message was deleted while later copies still showed it.
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` from `messages` is the whole mechanism: deleting a message removes its reference, and a session nobody references becomes sweepable again with no bookkeeping at the call sites. `record_session_message` is therefore called on **every** `create_session` / `upsert_session` that has a message id, including the existing-row branch.
- The newest-N cap counts only unreferenced sessions. Capping referenced ones would put a hard ceiling on how far back a conversation can be read, which is what this removes. Growth is bounded by media messages instead: ≤38 KB per image, ≤1.6 KB per 10 s recording. **AEIC sessions are not covered** — they keep their own `MAX_CACHED_SESSIONS`, and a decoded AEIC PNG is ~600 KB, so pinning those needs its own decision about disk.
- A session id may be referenced by several messages, so `create_session` guards **envelope metadata** (format, dimensions, size, fragment count; mode, duration, packet count for voice) and not the message id. Disagreeing metadata is the only real collision — two different pictures on one id, which would corrupt both.

### Region scope decoding (transport codes)

- `ROUTE_TYPE_TRANSPORT_FLOOD`/`ROUTE_TYPE_TRANSPORT_DIRECT` packets carry a 4-byte transport-code block; `parse_packet_envelope` exposes it as `transport_codes = (code_1, code_2)` (little-endian uint16s; `code_2` is reserved/0).
- `code_1` is a keyed MAC over the payload, not a stable per-region id: `code = HMAC-SHA256(SHA256("#" + region_name)[:16], payload_type || payload)[:2]` (firmware `TransportKeyStore.cpp`; reserved values `0x0000`/`0xFFFF` are nudged to `0x0001`/`0xFFFE`). There is **no** reverse lookup table — to name a packet's region you recompute the code per candidate region and check for a match (`app/region_resolver.py`).
- Candidate region names come from `app_settings.known_regions` (user-editable, seeded by migration 063 from `flood_scope` + channel `flood_scope_override`).
- Channel messages persist `messages.transport_code` (uint16, NULL = unscoped plain flood) and `messages.region` (resolved name, NULL = scoped but no list match) at ingest, so the chat region badge survives raw-packet purge. The packet inspector (`GET /packets/{id}` and the `raw_packet` WS broadcast) resolves region on the fly against the current list since it still holds the raw payload.

### Statistics time windows

`GET /statistics?window=` drives every time-bounded metric from one key (`app/stats_windows.py`): `1h`, `1d` (default), `1w`, `1M`, `3M`, `1y`, `all`. `all` means no lower bound — `window_cutoff` returns `None` and each query drops its `WHERE ... >= ?` clause rather than substituting a very old timestamp, so it reaches whatever the database still holds. An unknown key is a 422 from the router; `window_seconds()` falls back to the default for internal callers so a typo cannot take down the snapshot.

Untouched by the window: entity counts, message totals, the packet decrypted/undecrypted split, and `multibyte_rollout` — all all-time by nature. The activity table keeps its fixed 1h/24h/7d columns and adds a `window` count alongside them.

- **Chart bucketing.** `bucket_seconds_for_span` picks a round bucket width (1 min … 30 days) targeting ~200 points, so a year returns a readable series instead of 8,760 hourly rows. Width is derived from the *nominal* window, not from how much data landed in it, so the x-axis granularity depends only on what the user picked; `all` has no nominal span and uses the real one. Both `packets_over_time` and the noise-floor series bucket in SQL.
- **Scan caps.** `_packet_shape` and `_region_scope_senders` parse every row in Python, which a wide window makes unbounded. Both fetch at most `MAX_SCAN_ROWS` (250k) most-recent rows and set `truncated` when they hit it. **Never drop the flag** — a partial total presented as a whole one is worse than no number, and the UI leans on it to say the figures are a sample.
- **Noise floor.** Samples live in `noise_floor_samples` (migration 073), written once a minute by the radio-stats loop and pruned to a year. `timestamp` is the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, so a re-sample in the same second updates in place and window scans stay index-ordered. Buckets carry `min_dbm`/`max_dbm` next to the mean because averaging a wide window flattens a noisy hour and a quiet one into the same line.

### Clock drift measurement

Advert timestamps are recorded in `contact_clock_drift` (migration 076) by `ContactClockDriftRepository.record`, called from `_process_advertisement` **after** the contact upsert — the table has a foreign key onto `contacts` and enforcement is on for application queries. The math, thresholds, and sign convention all live in `app/clock_drift.py`; do not duplicate a threshold anywhere else.

- **Hourly buckets, keyed `(public_key, bucket_start)`**, and a bucket keeps its **largest** drift. Propagation delay only ever pushes a reading negative, so the maximum within an hour is the arrival that suffered least of it. `sample_count` still counts every arrival, so one flood heard over six paths is six samples in one row rather than six rows. A `WITHOUT ROWID` table on that composite key means per-contact window scans are covered by the primary key alone.
- **Nothing is ever deleted.** `ContactClockDriftRepository.compact` folds buckets older than `DRIFT_FULL_RESOLUTION_SECONDS` (90 days) down to one row per day, keeping the day's largest drift and the sum of every arrival counted across the hours it replaced. Hourly resolution is what shows a clock *jumping*, which only matters while it is recent; a years-old trend reads the same from daily points at a twenty-fourth of the rows (~60 kB per node per year instead of 1.4 MB). That is what makes "keep everything" affordable, so **do not reintroduce a retention cut** — the long view is the most valuable thing this table holds.
  - No schema marker separates daily rows from hourly ones, and none is needed: a day-aligned `bucket_start` *is* the marker, and every read path already re-buckets with integer division. A group that is already a single day-aligned row is skipped, so the steady-state call costs one query and the job is safe on a timer forever. A lone reading off midnight is still moved onto its day, or one straggler per day would never fold.
  - Runs on the 6-hourly tick in `app/services/radio_stats.py` — the only periodic maintenance loop the backend has. It runs only while the radio is connected, which is also the only time adverts arrive to grow the table.
- **Backfill.** Migration 076 replays stored advert packets so the feature starts with whatever history the database already holds — no lower time bound, since history is kept forever. Adverts are prefiltered in SQL by header byte (`header & 0x3C == 0x10`, enumerated), the public key is checked against known contacts *before* the Ed25519 verify (the expensive step, and the key filter already removes the corrupt captures that would fail it), and buckets are folded in memory before a single `executemany`. Capped at 500k packets, newest first, so hitting the cap costs the oldest history rather than the recent detail. The migration then applies the same daily fold inline, rather than leaving years of hourly rows in place until the first maintenance tick.
- **`ContactClockDriftRepository.get_for_contact`** returns a 30-day summary plus a chart-sized series re-bucketed in SQL, taking `MAX(drift)` per bucket with `path_len` as a bare column beside it (SQLite guarantees a bare column comes from the row that produced the `MAX`).
- **`StatisticsRepository._repeater_clock_drift`** builds the repeater aggregate: one row per repeater (its newest reading), a per-repeater series for the trend fit, and a mesh-wide series.

Two poisons are handled explicitly, and **both must stay handled** — each one was observed wrecking a surface before it was fixed:

- **Clocks that were never set** report time from boot, so they read as decades behind. They are excluded from the mean, from every ranking, and from the mesh-wide series (which shares one axis, and where one of them flattens every real repeater into the baseline). They are still counted in the severity bands and the histogram — a magnitude bin absorbs them harmlessly — and listed separately as `unset_clocks`.
- **Our own clock.** Every figure is relative to this server. `median_drift_seconds` is reported *signed* precisely so a mesh-wide offset is distinguishable from a mesh-wide problem: independent nodes do not drift together, so a large signed median indicts this server.

`fastest_rates` is filtered to `|rate| >= NOTABLE_RATE_SECONDS_PER_DAY`. A steady offset is a one-resync fix and already appears in the magnitude ranking; padding the trend list with steady clocks buries the ones that need the node looked at.

### Region-scope adoption stats (`region_scope`)

`GET /statistics` reports regional flood-scope uptake as two views with different denominators that intentionally will not agree:

- **Traffic** (`bucket_region_scope` in `path_utils.py`) counts flood-routed (`route_type` 0/1) GroupText packets across all channels, including undecryptable ones. Zero-hop/direct sends are excluded because firmware reaches them through the non-transport `sendZeroHop`/`sendDirect` overloads and they can never carry transport codes.
- **Senders** (`StatisticsRepository._region_scope_senders`) counts distinct senders with at least one scoped message. Attribution requires decryption, so it only covers channels we hold keys for — narrower, but self-validating (a decrypted packet is provably not a corrupt capture) and immune to one chatty node skewing the result. Identity is `sender_key` falling back to `sender_name`; scoping reads `messages.transport_code`, falling back to the linked raw packet for rows stored before region tagging existed.

`false_positive_floor` exists because corrupt RF captures land in `raw_packets` with effectively random headers and a share of them claim `TRANSPORT_FLOOD`. That garbage spreads near-uniformly across payload-type buckets, so it is measured directly from payload types the protocol does not define (`0x0C`/`0x0D`/`0x0E`) and averaged per bucket. **A `scoped_messages` count at or below the floor is not evidence of adoption**; surface the two together and never show the percentage alone. Do not "fix" the floor by removing it — without it the metric reads several times higher than reality.

Both traffic buckets come from one raw-packet scan (`_packet_shape`) shared with `path_hash_width`, so adding region stats costs no extra query or parse pass.

### Raw packet dedup policy

- Raw packet storage deduplicates by payload hash (`RawPacketRepository.create`), excluding routing/path bytes.
- Stored packet `id` is therefore a payload identity, not a per-arrival identity.
- Realtime raw-packet WS broadcasts include `observation_id` (unique per RF arrival) in addition to `id`.
- Frontend packet-feed features should key/dedupe by `observation_id`; use `id` only as the storage reference.
- Message-layer repeat handling (`_handle_duplicate_message` + `MessageRepository.add_path`) is separate from raw-packet storage dedup.

### Contact sync throttle

- `sync_recent_contacts_to_radio()` sets `_last_contact_sync = now` before the sync completes.
- This is intentional: if sync fails, the next attempt is still throttled to prevent a retry-storm against a flaky radio. Contacts will resync on the next scheduled cycle or on reconnect.

### Periodic advertisement

- Controlled by `app_settings.advert_interval` (seconds).
- `0` means disabled.
- Last send time tracked in `app_settings.last_advert_time`.

### Fanout bus

- All external integrations (MQTT, bots, webhooks, Apprise, SQS) are managed through the fanout bus (`app/fanout/`).
- Configs stored in `fanout_configs` table, managed via `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/fanout`.
- `broadcast_event()` in `websocket.py` dispatches to the fanout manager for `message`, `raw_packet`, and `contact` events.
- `on_message` and `on_raw` are scope-gated. `on_contact`, `on_telemetry`, and `on_health` are dispatched to all modules unconditionally (modules filter internally).
- Repeater telemetry broadcasts are emitted after `RepeaterTelemetryRepository.record()` in both `radio_sync.py` (auto-collect) and `routers/repeaters.py` (manual fetch). Contact LPP telemetry is similarly recorded to `ContactTelemetryRepository` and dispatched to fanout.
- The telemetry collection loop in `radio_sync.py` is unified: it iterates over both `tracked_telemetry_repeaters` and `tracked_telemetry_contacts`, dispatching to `_collect_repeater_telemetry` (type 2) or `_collect_contact_telemetry` (others). The daily check ceiling uses the combined count.
- The 60-second radio stats sampling loop in `radio_stats.py` dispatches an enriched health snapshot (radio identity + full stats) to all fanout modules after each sample.
- Community MQTT publishes raw packets only, but its derived `path` field for direct packets is emitted as comma-separated hop identifiers, not flat path bytes.
- See `app/fanout/AGENTS_fanout.md` for full architecture details and event payload shapes.

### Web Push notifications

Web Push is a standalone subsystem in `app/push/`, separate from the fanout module system. It sends browser push notifications for incoming messages even when the tab is closed.

- **Not a fanout module** — Web Push manages per-browser subscriptions (N browsers, each with its own endpoint and delivery state), unlike fanout which is one-config-to-one-destination.
- **VAPID keys**: auto-generated P-256 key pair on first startup, stored in `app_settings.vapid_private_key` / `vapid_public_key`. Cached in-module by `app/push/vapid.py`.
- **VAPID subject**: the JWT `sub` claim comes from `get_vapid_claims()` in `app/push/vapid.py`, configurable via `MESHCORE_VAPID_SUBJECT` (default `mailto:noreply@meshcore.local`). Apple's APNs rejects `.local` subjects with `403 BadJwtToken`, so iOS/Safari deployments must set a real `mailto:`/`https:` contact.
- **Dispatch**: `broadcast_event()` in `websocket.py` fires `push_manager.dispatch_message(data)` alongside fanout for `message` events. The manager checks the global `app_settings.push_conversations` list, then sends to all currently registered subscriptions via `pywebpush` (run in a thread executor).
- **Stale cleanup**: HTTP 404/410 from the push service triggers immediate subscription deletion.
- **Subscriptions stored** in `push_subscriptions` table with `UNIQUE(endpoint)` for upsert semantics.
- Requires HTTPS (self-signed OK) and outbound internet to reach browser push services.

## API Surface (all under `/api`)

### Radio
- `GET /radio/config` — includes `path_hash_mode`, `path_hash_mode_supported`, advert-location on/off, `multi_acks_enabled`, and companion repeat state (`repeat_enabled`, `repeat_supported`, `allowed_repeat_freqs`)
- `PATCH /radio/config` — may update `path_hash_mode` (`0..2`) when firmware supports it, `multi_acks_enabled`, and `repeat_enabled` (400 when firmware lacks repeat support, 422 when the frequency is not one the radio repeats on)
- `GET /radio/private-key` — export in-memory private key as hex (requires `MESHCORE_ENABLE_LOCAL_PRIVATE_KEY_EXPORT=true`)
- `PUT /radio/private-key`
- `POST /radio/advertise` — manual advert send; request body may set `mode` to `flood` or `zero_hop` (defaults to `flood`)
- `POST /radio/discover` — short mesh discovery sweep for nearby repeaters/sensors
- `POST /radio/discover-regions` — sweep nearby repeaters via the guest anon regions request; aggregates flood-allowed region names into a deduped union for merging into `known_regions` (direct-routed, so only in-range repeaters answer; optional `public_keys`, else recent repeaters)
- `POST /radio/trace` — send a multi-hop trace loop through known repeaters and back to the local radio
- `POST /radio/disconnect`
- `POST /radio/reboot`
- `POST /radio/reconnect`

### Contacts
- `GET /contacts`
- `GET /contacts/analytics` — unified keyed-or-name analytics payload, including `clock_drift` (30-day advert-timestamp drift summary + series; null when never measured)

- `POST /contacts`
- `POST /contacts/bulk-delete`
- `DELETE /contacts/{public_key}`
- `POST /contacts/{public_key}/mark-read`
- `POST /contacts/{public_key}/command`
- `POST /contacts/{public_key}/routing-override`
- `POST /contacts/{public_key}/trace`
- `POST /contacts/{public_key}/path-discovery` — discover forward/return paths, persist the learned direct route, and sync it back to the radio best-effort
- `POST /contacts/{public_key}/repeater/login` — one attempt on the effective route, then one flood retry on timeout
- `POST /contacts/{public_key}/repeater/status`
- `POST /contacts/{public_key}/repeater/lpp-telemetry`
- `POST /contacts/{public_key}/repeater/neighbors`
- `POST /contacts/{public_key}/repeater/acl`
- `POST /contacts/{public_key}/repeater/node-info`
- `POST /contacts/{public_key}/repeater/radio-settings`
- `POST /contacts/{public_key}/repeater/regions` — CLI region hierarchy, falling back to the guest anon flood-allowed names (`source`: `cli` or `anon`)
- `POST /contacts/{public_key}/repeater/advert-intervals`
- `POST /contacts/{public_key}/repeater/owner-info`
- `GET /contacts/{public_key}/repeater/telemetry-history` — stored telemetry history for a repeater (read-only, no radio access)
- `POST /contacts/{public_key}/telemetry` — on-demand CayenneLPP telemetry from any contact (persists in `contact_telemetry_history`)
- `GET /contacts/{public_key}/telemetry-history` — stored LPP telemetry history for a contact (read-only)
- `POST /contacts/{public_key}/room/login` — one attempt on the effective route, then one flood retry on timeout. Body `{password?, use_stored_credential?}`: `password` is three-state (`null`/absent = guest unless `use_stored_credential`, `""` = guest, else the password); `use_stored_credential=true` logs in with the room's server-side stored credential and never returns it.
- `POST /contacts/{public_key}/room/status`
- `POST /contacts/{public_key}/room/lpp-telemetry`
- `POST /contacts/{public_key}/room/acl`
- `GET /contacts/{public_key}/room/poll` — room poll/credential status; booleans only, never the stored credential
- `PUT /contacts/{public_key}/room/poll` — set stored credential (`credential_action` keep/set/clear; `credential=""` stores a guest login) and/or the background poll schedule; enabling polling requires a stored credential
- `DELETE /contacts/{public_key}/room/poll` — remove the stored credential and disable polling

The background room poller (`app/radio_sync.py` `_room_poll_loop`, started post-connect) periodically logs in to each subscribed room with its stored credential so the server enqueues its message delta; the existing drain/dedup pipeline captures it. Reliability rests on the incoming-message dedup (re-pulling an overlapping delta is a no-op), a durable per-room subscription (`room_poll_subscriptions`), the shared radio lock (`radio_operation(blocking=False, suspend_auto_fetch=True)` — busy = skip), and exponential backoff; an explicit `LOGIN_FAILED` disables the subscription. MeshCore has no message cursor, so this is "keep the session current + drain," never "fetch since N".

### Channels
- `GET /channels`
- `GET /channels/{key}/detail`
- `POST /channels`
- `POST /channels/bulk-hashtag`

- `POST /messages/{message_id}/retry` — retransmit an outgoing message. DMs reuse the original timestamp (byte-identical, so the recipient dedups it as a retry) and restart their retry run under the current cap; channel messages route to the resend machinery, where `?new_timestamp=true` creates a new row
- `POST /messages/{message_id}/cancel` — stop the attempts not yet made; `stopped_pending_sends` says whether anything was still scheduled (either way the message ends up `canceled`)
- `DELETE /messages/{message_id}` — cancel then drop our copy, broadcasting `message_deleted`. Local only
- `POST /messages/mcmp-estimate` — compressed wire size of a draft (`{text, version}` → `{wire_bytes, compressed}`) for the live compose counter; pure computation, `text` capped at 4096 chars

### Packets
- `GET /packets/undecrypted/count`

- `GET /packets/{packet_id}` — fetch one stored raw packet by row ID for on-demand inspection
- `POST /packets/decrypt/historical`
- `POST /packets/maintenance`

### Read state

- `POST /settings/muted-channels/toggle`
- `POST /settings/mcmp/set` — configure MCMP for a conversation (`{type: "contact"|"channel", id, enabled, version?}`; `version` 2 or 3, omit to leave unchanged); broadcasts a `contact`/`channel` event

### Fanout
- `GET /fanout` — list all fanout configs
- `POST /fanout` — create new fanout config
- `PATCH /fanout/{id}` — update fanout config (triggers module reload)
- `DELETE /fanout/{id}` — delete fanout config (stops module)
- `POST /fanout/bots/disable-until-restart` — stop bot modules and keep bots disabled until restart

### Statistics
- `GET /statistics?window=1h|1d|1w|1M|3M|1y|all` — aggregated mesh network stats for one time window (entity counts, message/packet splits, activity windows, busiest channels, packet activity series, `region_scope` regional adoption, noise-floor series). Defaults to `1d`; unknown windows are 422

- `POST /push/subscriptions/{id}/test` — send test notification
- `GET /push/conversations` — global list of push-enabled conversation state keys
- `POST /push/conversations/toggle` — add or remove a conversation from the global push list

### WebSocket
- `WS /ws`

## WebSocket Events

- `health` — radio connection status (broadcast on change, personal on connect)
- `contact` — single contact upsert (from advertisements and radio sync)
- `contact_resolved` — prefix contact reconciled to a full contact row (payload: `{ previous_public_key, contact }`)
- `message` — new message (channel or DM, from packet processor or send endpoints)
- `message_acked` — ACK/echo update for existing message (ack count + paths)
- `raw_packet` — every incoming RF packet (for real-time packet feed UI)
- `contact_deleted` — contact removed from database (payload: `{ public_key }`)
- `channel` — single channel upsert/update (payload: full `Channel`)
- `channel_deleted` — channel removed from database (payload: `{ key }`)
- `error` — toast notification (reconnect failure, missing private key, stuck radio startup, etc.)
- `success` — toast notification (historical decrypt complete, etc.)

Backend WS sends go through typed serialization in `events.py`. Initial WS connect sends `health` only. Contacts/channels are loaded by REST.
Client sends `"ping"` text; server replies `{"type":"pong"}`.

## Data Model Notes

Main tables:
- `contacts` (includes `first_seen` for contact age tracking and `direct_path_hash_mode` / `route_override_*` for DM routing)
- `channels`
  Includes optional `flood_scope_override` for channel-specific regional sends and optional `path_hash_mode_override` for per-channel path hop width.
- `messages` (includes `sender_name`, `sender_key` for per-contact channel message attribution)
- `raw_packets`
- `contact_advert_paths` (recent unique advertisement paths per contact, keyed by contact + path bytes + hop count)
- `contact_name_history` (tracks name changes over time)
- `repeater_telemetry_history` (time-series telemetry snapshots for tracked repeaters)
- `contact_telemetry_history` (time-series LPP telemetry snapshots for tracked contacts; same schema as repeater table)
- `fanout_configs` (MQTT, bot, webhook, Apprise, SQS integration configs)
- `push_subscriptions` (Web Push browser subscriptions with delivery metadata; UNIQUE on endpoint)
- `app_settings` (includes `vapid_private_key` and `vapid_public_key` for Web Push VAPID signing)

Contact route state is canonicalized on the backend:
- stored route inputs: `direct_path`, `direct_path_len`, `direct_path_hash_mode`, `direct_path_updated_at`, plus optional `route_override_*`
- computed route surface: `effective_route`, `effective_route_source`, `direct_route`, `route_override`
- removed legacy names: `last_path`, `last_path_len`, `out_path_hash_mode`

Frontend and send paths should consume the canonical route surface rather than reconstructing precedence from raw fields.

Repository writes should prefer typed models such as `ContactUpsert` over ad hoc dict payloads when adding or updating schema-coupled data.

`max_radio_contacts` is the configured radio contact capacity baseline. Favorites reload first, the app refills non-favorite working-set contacts to about 80% of that capacity, and periodic offload triggers once occupancy reaches about 95%.

`app_settings` fields in active model:
- `max_radio_contacts`
- `auto_decrypt_dm_on_advert`
- `last_message_times`
- `advert_interval`
- `last_advert_time`
- `flood_scope`
- `known_regions`
- `blocked_keys`, `blocked_names`, `discovery_blocked_types`
- `tracked_telemetry_repeaters`, `tracked_telemetry_contacts`
- `auto_resend_channel`
- `telemetry_interval_hours`

Note: MQTT, community MQTT, and bot configs were migrated to the `fanout_configs` table (migrations 36-38).

## Security Posture (intentional)

- No per-user authn/authz model; optionally, operators may enable app-wide HTTP Basic auth for both HTTP and WS entrypoints.
- No CORS restriction (`*`).
- Bot code executes user-provided Python via `exec()`.

These are product decisions for trusted-network deployments; do not flag as accidental vulnerabilities.

## Errata & Known Non-Issues

### Sender timestamps are 1-second resolution (protocol constraint)

The MeshCore radio protocol encodes `sender_timestamp` as a 4-byte little-endian integer (Unix seconds). This is a firmware-level wire format — the radio, the Python library (`commands/messaging.py`), and the decoder (`decoder.py`) all read/write exactly 4 bytes. Millisecond Unix timestamps would overflow 4 bytes, so higher resolution is not possible without a firmware change.

**Consequence:** Message dedup still operates at 1-second granularity because the radio protocol only provides second-resolution `sender_timestamp`. Do not attempt to fix this by switching to millisecond timestamps — it will break echo dedup (the echo's 4-byte timestamp won't match the stored value) and overflow `to_bytes(4, "little")`. Incoming DMs now share the same second-resolution content identity tradeoff as channel echoes: same-contact same-text same-second observations collapse onto one stored row.

### Outgoing DM echoes remain undecrypted

When our own outgoing DM is heard back via `RX_LOG_DATA` (self-echo, loopback), `_process_direct_message` passes `our_public_key=None` for the outgoing direction, disabling the outbound hash check in the decoder. The decoder's inbound check (`src_hash == their_first_byte`) fails because the source is us, not the contact — so decryption returns `None`. This is by design: outgoing DMs are stored directly by the send endpoint, so no message is lost.

### Infinite setup retry on connection monitor

When `post_connect_setup()` fails (e.g. `export_and_store_private_key` raises `RuntimeError` because the radio didn't respond), `_setup_complete` is never set to `True`. The connection monitor sees `connected and not setup_complete` and retries every 5 seconds — indefinitely. This is intentional: the radio may be rebooting, waking from sleep, or otherwise temporarily unresponsive. We keep retrying so that setup completes automatically once the radio becomes available, without requiring manual intervention.

### DELETE channel returns 200 for non-existent keys

`DELETE /api/channels/{key}` returns `{"status": "ok"}` even if the key didn't exist. This is intentional — the postcondition is "channel doesn't exist," which is satisfied regardless of whether it existed before. No 404 needed.

### Contact lat/lon 0.0 vs NULL

MeshCore uses `0.0` as the sentinel for "no GPS coordinates" (see `models.py` `to_radio_dict`). The upsert SQL uses `COALESCE(excluded.lat, contacts.lat)`, which preserves existing values when the new value is `NULL` — but `0.0` is not `NULL`, so it overwrites previously valid coordinates. This is intentional: we always want the most recent location data. If a device stops broadcasting GPS, the old coordinates are presumably stale/wrong, so overwriting with "not available" (`0.0`) is the correct behavior.

## Editing Checklist

When changing backend behavior:
1. Update/add router and repository tests.
2. Confirm WS event contracts when payload shape changes.
3. Run `PYTHONPATH=. uv run pytest tests/ -v`.
4. If API contract changed, update frontend types and AGENTS docs.
