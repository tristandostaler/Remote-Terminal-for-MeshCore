"""
Centralized packet processing for MeshCore messages.

This module handles:
- Storing raw packets
- Decrypting channel messages (GroupText) with stored channel keys
- Decrypting direct messages with stored contact keys (if private key available)
- Creating message entries for successfully decrypted packets
- Broadcasting updates via WebSocket

This is the primary path for message processing when channel/contact keys
are offloaded from the radio to the server.
