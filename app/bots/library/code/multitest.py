"""Collects unique message paths for 6 seconds. Seeded from meshcore-bot's multitest.

Say ``multitest``, then have stations transmit; after 6 seconds it reports the
distinct routing paths of everything heard in the window, each shown as its
repeater hops separated by commas (``2f52f0,bf61f2,8e31d2``). Flood repeats
that merely extend an already-observed route by more hops are stages of the
same propagation, not new routes, and are collapsed into the longest
