"""Welcomes first-time posters in a channel. Seeded from meshcore-bot's greeter.

Tracks who it has greeted in persistent ``ctx.state`` (per sender+channel), so
restarts don't re-greet. Note: on first enable every sender counts as new —
including long-time regulars — so enable it on quiet channels first, or
pre-mark regulars by letting it run in a busy hour before announcing it.
meshcore-bot's dead-air delay and defer-to-human behaviors are not ported; add
them here in code if your mesh wants them.
