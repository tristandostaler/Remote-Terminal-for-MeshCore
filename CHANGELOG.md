## [Unreleased]

* Feature: Bots workspace — a new top-level view (sidebar › Tools › Bots) merging meshcore-bot's functionality: the full meshcore-bot library as 40 built-in bots (weather, solar, mesh info & tracing, sports, fun, emergency alerts, admin tools…) seeded as editable Python scripts in the database, with per-bot settings panels, scope/limits, an in-app code editor, a sandboxed test console, and per-bot run history
* Feature: One bot, many triggers — keyword commands, cron schedules (5-field crontab + @presets, day-of-week 0=Monday), mesh events (new contact), and token-gated inbound webhooks (`POST /api/hooks/{slug}`); new `ctx` API supports cross-channel sends, DMs, persistent state, HTTP, geocoding, and i18n
* Feature: Scheduler tab — standalone cron messages to any channel with mesh-stat placeholders and optional region scoping
* Feature: Feeds tab — RSS/JSON-API subscriptions posting new items to channels, with format templates, previews, and an SSRF guard
* Feature: Bots dashboard, live engine log view (WebSocket), and Engine settings (command prefix, mentions, rate limits, language auto-detection with 10 ported locales, banned users, profanity filter, global admin list)
* Feature: Discord and Telegram one-way channel bridges as fanout integrations
* Feature: Multibyte Rollout panel in Settings › Statistics — node-level multibyte path adoption (contacts and repeaters by direct-route hop width), complementing the packet-level Path Hash Width chart
* Note: meshcore-bot's channelpause and reload commands are intentionally not ported — the workspace's per-bot enable toggles, the disable-all kill switch, and hot reload on save supersede them
* Change: `help <command>` names every trigger the command answers to instead of stopping at the first six, so operator-added keywords and the words merged bots absorbed are discoverable from the mesh; the bare command list marks how many extra triggers each command has (`hello (+27)`), or spells them out inline when Bots › help › "Spell out aliases in the command list" is on
* Change: Built-in bots no longer hand-roll message splitting — mailbox, help, ping, channels, sports, neighbors, repeater, trace, gwx, dice and wx now send long replies through `ctx.reply_split`, so answers that used to be cut off at ~180 characters go out whole as numbered `(i/n)` parts (and pack more per part on MCMP conversations)
* Change: Overlapping built-in bots merged, 52 down to 40 — `test` joined `ping` (one liveness check that also reports hops, region and clock offset), `cmd` joined `help`, `roll` joined `dice`, `worldcup`/`worldcup-live` joined `sports`, `hfcond`/`aurora` joined `solar` (they were fetching the same HamQSL document twice), and `joke`, `dadjoke`, `catfact`, `funfact`, `fortunes` and `magic8` became one `fun` bot with a per-source on/off setting. Merged-away bots are retired on the next startup: an enabled one switches its survivor on so the command keeps answering, and one you had edited or configured is kept — disabled and renamed `(retired) …` — instead of being deleted
* Change: Bots start scoped to `#bot` / `#bots` plus DMs instead of every channel — enabling a built-in no longer makes the node answer commands on Public and on every other channel it carries. The two hashtag keys are derived from their names, identical on every node, so the default works before you join the channels and starts answering the moment you do; widen or narrow it per bot under Bots › Settings › "Where it runs", where a scoped channel this node has not joined is now labelled as such. Existing bots that were still at the old "all channels" default **and still disabled** are retargeted on upgrade (migration 071); anything you enabled or scoped by hand is left exactly as it is
* Change: Settings › "MQTT & Automation" is now "Integrations"; legacy fanout Python bots migrate automatically into the Bots workspace (migration 064) and keep their exact behavior via the legacy `def bot(**kwargs)` wrapper
